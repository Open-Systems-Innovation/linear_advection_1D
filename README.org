#+TITLE: 1D Linear Advection using Finite Elements
The code in ~main.c~ uses PETSc to solve the 1D linear advection equation with finite elements. The linear advection equation is given by:

$$
  \frac{\delta u}{\delta x} = \frac{\delta u}{\delta t}, ~ 0 < x < 10
$$

Where the spatial domain is between 0 and 10.

Here we use constant (Dirichlet) boundary conditions defined as follows:

$$
u = 0 ~ \text{for} ~ x = 10, ~ x = 0
$$
